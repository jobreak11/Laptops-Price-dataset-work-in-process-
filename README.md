# Details && sources
------------------------
These are about dataset from Kaggle, and a code set I've coded by myself.
Thanks to Kaggle source I can use datasets for making data mining. 
Data transformation is important for data roles, so I prepared some codes that might be helpful for anyone who wants to learn Python coding.
However, If you understand how each function works, you can understand how to clean, transfer, and predict data.

Currently, this project is a work in process.\
