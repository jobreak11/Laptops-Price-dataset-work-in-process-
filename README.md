# Details && sources
------------------------
These are about dataset from Kaggle, and a code set I've coded by myself.
Thanks to Kaggle source I can use datasets for making data mining. 
Data transformation is important for data roles, so I prepared some codes that might be helpful for anyone who wants to learn Python coding.
However, If you understand how each function works, you can understand how to clean, transfer, and predict data. \

# What you can do to this dataset or codes?
------------------------
The important thing for coding is repeatable code. I discovered many sources use the same function because they chose the same source for their projects. Data roles quitely require the same output that they expected from our coding, so we do not need to code like other languages. (Just data cleaning, data mining, data visualization)
That's why these sources will be beneficial for anyone who starting coding for the first time and wants to do data roles or anything that does not require that much programming understanding. (you must know how to do data prediction I guess. At least, you do not need to create a function on your right????)

# In my opinion since I studied different programming languages (no need to read)
------------------------
Since then, I learned other languages like C, R, and SQL. I feel like Python is the easiest language right now.
As you can see, many job roles require Python skills. I think if you want to be good at data roles you do not need to study other languages like C or anything that is not related to. (not included SQL or R. That's job requirement)
However, If you learn more languages, you will have a solid understanding of programming way more than learning only one language.

### If you want to understand more about what programming is, my c projects might be your answer.
Currently, this project is a work in process.\
