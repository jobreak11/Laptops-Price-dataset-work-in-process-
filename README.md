# Details && sources
------------------------
These are about dataset from Kaggle, and a code set I've coded by myself.
Thanks to Kaggle source I can use datasets for making data mining. 
Data transformation is important for data roles, so I prepared some codes that might be helpful for anyone who wants to learn Python coding.
However, If you understand how each function works, you can understand how to clean, transfer, and predict data.

# What you can do to this dataset or codes?
------------------------
The important thing for coding is repeatable code. I discovered many sources use the same function because they chose the same source for their projects.
That's why these sources will be beneficial for anyone who starting coding for the first time and wants to do data roles.

# In my opinion since I studied different programming languages
------------------------
Since then, I learned other languages like C, R, and SQL. I feel like Python is the easiest language right now.
As you can see, many job roles require Python skills. I think if you want to be good at data roles you do not need to study other languages like C or anything that is not related to.
However, If you learn more languages, you will have a solid understanding of programming way more than learning only one language.

### If you want to understand more about what programming is, my c projects might be your answer.\
Currently, this project is a work in process.\
